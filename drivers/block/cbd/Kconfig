config BLK_DEV_CBD
	tristate "CXL Block Device (Experimental)"
	depends on DEV_DAX && FS_DAX
	help
	  CBD allows you to register a persistent memory device as a CBD transport.
	  You can use this persistent memory as a data cache to improve your block
	  device performance. Additionally, if you enable CBD_MULTIHOST, cbd allows
	  you to access block devices on a remote host as if they were local disks.

	  Select 'y' to build this module directly into the kernel.
	  Select 'm' to build this module as a loadable kernel module.

	  If unsure say 'N'.

config CBD_CRC
	bool "Enable CBD checksum"
	default N
	depends on BLK_DEV_CBD
	help
	  When CBD_CRC is enabled, all data sent by CBD will include
	  a checksum. This includes a data checksum, a submit entry checksum,
	  and a completion entry checksum. This ensures the integrity of the
	  data transmitted through the CXL memory device.

config CBD_DEBUG
	bool "Enable CBD debug"
	default N
	depends on BLK_DEV_CBD
	help
	  When CBD_DEBUG is enabled, cbd module will print more messages
	  for debugging. But that will affact performance, so do not use it
	  in production case.

config CBD_MULTIHOST
	bool "multi-hosts CXL Dlock Device"
	default N
	depends on BLK_DEV_CBD
	help
	  When CBD_MULTIHOST is enabled, cbd allows the use of a shared memory device
	  as a cbd transport. In this mode, the blkdev and backends on different
	  hosts can be connected through the shared memory device, enabling cross-node
	  disk access.

	  IMPORTANT: This Require your shared memory device support Hardware-consistency
	  as CXL 3.0 described.
