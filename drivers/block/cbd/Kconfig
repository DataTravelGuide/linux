config BLK_DEV_CBD
	tristate "CXL Block Device (Experimental)"
	depends on DEV_DAX && FS_DAX
	help
	  CBD allows you to register a CXL memory device as a CBD transport.
	  This enables you to expose any block device through this CBD
	  transport for access by others. Any machine that has registered
	  the same CXL memory device can see the block devices exposed
	  through this CBD transport and can map them locally, allowing
	  remote block devices to be accessed as if they were local block
	  devices.

	  Select 'y' to build this module directly into the kernel.
	  Select 'm' to build this module as a loadable kernel module.

	  If unsure say 'N'.

config CBD_CRC
	bool "Enable CBD checksum"
	default N
	depends on BLK_DEV_CBD
	help
	  When CBD_CRC is enabled, all data sent by CBD will include
	  a checksum. This includes a data checksum, a submit entry checksum,
	  and a completion entry checksum. This ensures the integrity of the
	  data transmitted through the CXL memory device.

config CBD_DEBUG
	bool "Enable CBD debug"
	default N
	depends on BLK_DEV_CBD
	help
	  When CBD_DEBUG is enabled, cbd module will print more messages
	  for debugging. But that will affact performance, so do not use it
	  in production case.

config CBD_MULTIHOST
	bool "multi-hosts CXL Dlock Device"
	default N
	depends on BLK_DEV_CBD
	help
	  When CBD_MULTIHOST is enabled, cbd allows the use of a shared memory device
	  as a cbd transport. In this mode, the blkdev and backends on different
	  hosts can be connected through the shared memory device, enabling cross-node
	  disk access.
